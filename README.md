Spotify Skip Prediction using Flask

This was my final internship project. This app basically predicts whether or not a user will skip a song based on their usage data
RandomForestClassifier was used to train the model that was deployed.

To the run the application, simply open command prompt in the directory where all the files are by writing "cmd" in the Address Bar

After opening cmd write "flask run"
After this, copy the URL displayed in command prompt and paste it in your browser.
